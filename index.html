        <h1>The Shades of NIN</h1>  
        <h2>Trent and Mark</h2>
        <p>If you had to associate the Nine Inch Nails with one film director
          and David Fincher was not available, Mark Romanek would probably be the guy.
        </p>
        <h3>Trent</h3>
        <p>Good old tortured Trent. Ohio born. Radio raised. Trent Reznor is the only
          artist I can think of who made the jump from New Wave to Industrial Metal. 
        </p>
        <h3>Mark</h3>
        <p>Probably most famous for directing the incredibly sultry video for 
          <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOzayDpWoI" target="_blank">FIONA APPLE's "CRIMINAL,"</a></em>
         Mark Romanek is a superlative smut peddler. It's fair to say that I love his smut. It's fantastic.</p>
        <p>Nestled in his 
        lengthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Romanek_videography" target="_blank">videography</a> are two
        of the most popular and visually significant Nine Inch Nails videos.
        </p>
        <h2>The Videos</h2>
        <p>1994's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTFwQP86BRs" target="_blank">Closer</a> video and the 1997 offering for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn3j6-yQKWQ" target="_blank">The Perfect Drug</a>
          are artistic masterpieces in their own right. Together, they serve as important bookends to the band's critical formative era.</p>
        <p>Distinct color palettes define each video and benchmark new-found depth in the Nine Inch Nails' aesthetic identity. Beginning with Closer and ending with The Perfect Drug,
          Trent Reznor and company transcended the muddy, raucous <em>Pretty Hate Machine</em> phase to embrace a nuanced, sophisticated, and deeply macabre complexity. Consciously or not,
          the colors used in each video establish specific dimensionality to the chrysalis phase in the NIN catalog.</p>
        <h3>YOU GET ME CLOSER TO GOD</h3>
        <img src="nin.png" alt="Color Palette for NIN's Closer">
        <p>Blending the Marquis de Sade and HH Holmes with a splash of Man Ray, "Closer" deploys a suite of tans and ochres to invest
          the video in carnal hues evoking flesh. The victorian-inspired BDSM collage (later repurposed and interpolated for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BJkDyCdw0c" target="_blank">
          opening credits</a>of <em>Se7en</em>), marks the introduction of <em>The Downward Spiral</em> album cycle, which featured work recorded in the home at 10050 Cielo Drive
        in Los Angeles, which was more famous at the site of the Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Parent, and Jay Sebring
      on the night of August 9, 1969.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously sensual and disturbing, the video captures alarming, if erotic, relationships between people whose highest hopes of transcendence result instead
        in the capture of menacing bodily passions.</p>
      <h3>I SEE THE TRUTH WHEN IM ALL STUPID-EYED</h3>
      <img src="perfectdrug_perfect.png" alt="Color palette for Perfect Drug video.">
      <p>This homage to absinthe, Edward Gorey, and the Garden District of New Orleans signals Trent Reznor's departure from Los Angeles,
        establishment in New Orleans, and a speculated embrace of heroin. Intense melancholy cut with fits of pharmacological mania inspire Shades
        of blue and green. Less anthemic and more structurally complex than its predecessor, this video, its color palette and the images it inspires
        envat the Nine Inch Nails' work in a cool bath of Victorian sorrow.</p>
